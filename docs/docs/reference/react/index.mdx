The Nhost React client exports a React provider, hooks, and helpers that make it easier to work with Nhost in your React app. If you're using React with Next.js, you should use the [Nhost Next.js client](/reference/nextjs).

## Installation

Install the Nhost React client together with GraphQL:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install @nhost/react graphql
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @nhost/react graphql
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initializing

Initialize a single `nhost` instance using your Nhost `subdomain` and `region`:

```jsx title=src/lib/nhost.js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/react'

export const nhost = new NhostClient({
  subdomain: '<your-subdomain>',
  region: '<your-region>'
})
```

## Using custom URLs

There are cases where you might want to use a custom URL for one or more of the
services (e.g: when you are self-hosting or you are running services on custom
ports). You can do this by passing in the custom URLs when initializing the
Nhost client:

```ts title=src/lib/nhost.ts
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/react'

export const nhost = new NhostClient({
  authUrl: 'https://auth.mydomain.com/v1',
  storageUrl: 'https://storage.mydomain.com/v1',
  graphqlUrl: 'https://graphql.mydomain.com/v1',
  functionsUrl: 'https://functions.mydomain.com/v1'
})
```

Import `nhost` and wrap your app with the `NhostProvider`.

```jsx title=src/App.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import { NhostClient, NhostProvider } from '@nhost/react'
import { nhost } from './lib/nhost'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostProvider nhost={nhost}>
      <App />
    </NhostProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
export { nhost }
```

:::info

The `nhost` instance created with the `NhostClient` above is the same as the [JavaScript Nhost client](/reference/javascript).
