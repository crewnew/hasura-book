The Nhost Vue client exports a Nhost client that can be installed as a [Vue plugin](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins.html), and [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html) that make it easier to work with Nhost in your Vue app.

## Installation

Install the Nhost Vue client together with GraphQL:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install @nhost/vue graphql
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @nhost/vue graphql
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initializing

Initialize a single `nhost` instance using your Nhost `subdomain` and `region`,
and install it as a plugin in your Vue app:

```js title=src/main.js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/vue'
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  subdomain: '<your-subdomain>',
  region: '<your-region>'
})

createApp(App).use(nhost).mount('#app')
```

## Using custom URLs

There are cases where you might want to use a custom URL for one or more of the
services (e.g: when you are self-hosting or you are running services on custom
ports). You can do this by passing in the custom URLs when initializing the
Nhost client:

```js title=src/main.js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/vue'
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  authUrl: 'https://auth.mydomain.com/v1',
  storageUrl: 'https://storage.mydomain.com/v1',
  graphqlUrl: 'https://graphql.mydomain.com/v1',
  functionsUrl: 'https://functions.mydomain.com/v1'
})

createApp(App).use(nhost).mount('#app')
```
