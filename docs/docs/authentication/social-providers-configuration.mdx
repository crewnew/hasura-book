## Enabling Social Sign-In Provider

To start with social sign-in, select your project in Nhost Dashboard and go to **Settings -> Sign-In Methods**.

## Implementing sign-in experience

Use the [Nhost JavaScript SDK](/reference/javascript) and the `signIn()` method to implement social sign-in for your project.

**Example**: Sign in a user with [GitHub](/authentication/sign-in-with-github).

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'github'
})
```

During the sign-in flow, the user is redirected to the provider's website to authenticate. After the user authenticates, they are redirected back to your Nhost project's [**Client URL**](/authentication#client-url) by default. You can change where the user gets redirected to after authentication by passing the `redirectTo` option.

**Example:** Redirect the user to `https://staging.example.com/welcome` after they complete the sign-in flow.

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'github'
  options: {
    redirectTo: "https://staging.example.com/welcome",
  },
})
```

In the example above, it's important to note that the `redirectTo` URL must be part of the [Allowed Redirect URLs](/authentication#allowed-redirect-urls) of your Nhost project.

## Provider OAuth scopes

Scopes are a mechanism in OAuth to allow or limit an application's access to a user's account.

By default, Nhost sets the scope to get the name, email, and avatar URL for each user. Editing scope is not currently supported.

## Provider OAuth Tokens

Nhost saves both access and refresh tokens for each user and provider in the `auth.user_providers` table. These tokens can be used to interact with the provider if needed.
