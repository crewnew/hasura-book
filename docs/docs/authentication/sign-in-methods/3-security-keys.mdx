- [Apple Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201371)
- [Apple Face ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208109)
- [Yubico security keys](https://www.yubico.com/)
- Android Fingerprint sensors

## Configuration

Enable the Security Key sign-in method in the Nhost dashboard under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Security Keys**.

You need to make sure you also set a valid client URL under **Settings -> Authentication -> Client URL**.

## Sign Up

Users must use an email address to sign up with a security key.

Here's an example of how to sign up a user with a security key with our [JavaScript SDK](/reference/javascript):

**Example:**: Sign up with a security key:

```tsx
const { error, session } = await nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  securityKey: true
})

// Something unexpected happened, for instance, the user canceled the process
if (error) {
  console.log(error)
  return
}

// if there is no error and no session, the user needs to verify their email address.
if (!session) {
  console.log(
    'You need to verify your email address by clicking the link in the email we sent you.'
  )
  return
}

//Sign-up is complete!
console.log(session.user)
```

## Sign In

Once a user signed up with a security key, and verfied their email if needed, they can use it to sign in.

**Example:** Sign in with a security key:

```tsx
const { error, session } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  securityKey: true
})

// Something unexpected happened, for instance, the user canceled the process
if (error) {
  console.log(error)
  return
}

if (!session) {
  // Something unexpected happened
  console.log(error)
  return
}

// User is signed in
```

## Add a Security Key

Any signed-in user with a verified email can add a security key to their user account. Once a security key is added, the user can use it their email and the security key to sign in.

It's possible to add multiple security keys to a user account.

**Example:** Add a security key to a user account:

```tsx
const { key, error } = await nhost.auth.addSecurityKey()

// Something unexpected happened
if (error) {
  console.log(error)
  return
}

// Successfully added a new security key
console.log(key.id)
```

A nickname can be associated with each security key to make it easier to manage security keys in the future.

**Example:** Add a security key with a nickname:

```tsx
await nhost.auth.addSecurityKey('iPhone')
```

## List or Remove Security Keys

To list and remove security keys, use GraphQL and set permissions on the `auth.security_keys` table:

**Example:** Get all security keys for a user:

```graphql
query securityKeys($userId: uuid!) {
  authUserSecurityKeys(where: { userId: { _eq: $userId } }) {
    id
    nickname
  }
}
```

**Example:** Remove a security key:

```graphql
mutation removeSecurityKey($id: uuid!) {
  deleteAuthUserSecurityKey(id: $id) {
    id
  }
}
```
