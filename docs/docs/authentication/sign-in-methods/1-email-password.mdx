The Email and Password sign-in method is always enabled for all Nhost projects.

## Sign Up

Users must first sign up to be able to sign in.

**Example:** Sign up users using the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript).

```js
await nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

If you've turned on email verification in your project's **Authentication Settings**, a user will be sent a verification email upon signup. The user must click the verification link in the email before they can sign in.

## Sign In

After the user has successfully signed up, they can sign in.

**Example:** Sign in users using the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript).

```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

## Email Verification

If you want to require users to verify their email before they can sign in, you can enable this under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Email and Password** by checking the **Require Verified Emails** checkbox.

If **Require Verified Emails** is enabled, users automatically get a verification email when they sign up. The user must click the verification link in the email before they can sign in. It's possible to edit the ["email-verify" email template](/authentication/email-templates).

It's possible to manually send a verification email to the user using [`nhost.auth.sendVerificationEmail()`](/reference/javascript/auth/send-verification-email).
