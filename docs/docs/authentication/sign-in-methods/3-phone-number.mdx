Follow this guide to sign in users with a phone number (SMS).

## Configuration

You need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) to use this feature because all SMS are sent through Twilio.

Enable the Phone Number (SMS) sign-in method in the Nhost dashboard under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Phone Number (SMS)**.

You need to insert the following settings in the Nhost dashboard from Twilio:

- Account SID
- Auth Token
- Messaging Service SID (or a Twilio phone number)

## Sign In

To sign in users with a phone number is a two-step process:

1. Send a one-time password (OTP) to the user's phone number.
2. The user uses the OTP to sign in.

```js
// Step 1: Send OTP to the user's phone number
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123'
})

// Step 2: Sign in user using their phone number and OTP
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123'
  // highlight-next-line
  otp: '123456',
})
```

The first time a user signs in using a phone number, the user is created. That means you don't need to sign up users before signing in users.

:::info

Phone numbers should start with `+` (not `00`) to follow the [E.164 formatting standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164).
