Environment Variables are key-value pairs configured outside your source code. They are used to store environment-specific values such as API keys.

Environment Variables are available for:

- [Hasura GraphQL Engine](/graphql)
- [Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions)

When an Environment Variable has updated the changes happen immediately for Hasura GraphQL Engine. For Serverless Functions, a new deployment via [Git](/platform/git) is required.

## Custom Environment Variables

You can manage your project's Environment Variables in the Nhost Dashboard or by using the configuration file.

### Dashboard

![Environment Variables](/img/platform/environment-variables/environment-variables.png)

Environment Variables can be managed in the Nhost Dashboard under **Settings** &rarr; **Environment Variables**.

### Configuration File

Environment Variables can also be managed by adding new `[[global.environment]]` sections to the `nhost.toml` file.

```toml
[global]
[[global.environment]]
name = 'MY_ENV_VAR'
value = '<first-value>'

[[global.environment]]
name = 'MY_OTHER_ENV_VAR'
value = '<second-value>'

# ... omitted for brevity
```

These environment variables will also be available on the Nhost Dashboard after committing and pushing the changes to your Git repository.

## System Environment Variables

System environment variables are automatically generated from the configuration file and your project's subdomain and region.

The following system environment variables are available:

- `NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET`
- `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ~~`NHOST_BACKEND_URL`~~ ([deprecated](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/discussions/1319))
- `NHOST_SUBDOMAIN`
- `NHOST_REGION`
- `NHOST_HASURA_URL`
- `NHOST_AUTH_URL`
- `NHOST_GRAPHQL_URL`
- `NHOST_STORAGE_URL`
- `NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL`
- `NHOST_JWT_SECRET`

`NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET`, `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `NHOST_JWT_SECRET` are populated with values from the configuration file. The rest of the system environment variables are populated with values from your project's subdomain and region.

**Example values**:

```text
NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET=e7w36ag287qn5qry795f6ymm57qgvqup

NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=ns3sfjgdw4y6zeqthwnnw347dzh8wyj4
