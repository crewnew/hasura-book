This package creates a Stripe GraphQL API, allowing for interaction with data at Stripe.

Here's an example of how to use the Stripe GraphQL API to get a list of invoices for a specific Stripe customer:

<Tabs >
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request" default>

```graphql
query {
  stripe {
    customer(id: "cus_xxx") {
      id
      name
      invoices {
        data {
          id
          created
          paid
          hostedInvoiceUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```json
{
  "data": {
    "stripe": {
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_xxx",
        "name": "joe@example.com",
        "invoices": {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": "in_1MUmwnCCF9wuB4xxxxxxxx",
              "created": 1674806769,
              "paid": true,
              "hostedInvoiceUrl": "https://invoice.stripe.com/i/acct_xxxxxxx/test_YWNjdF8xS25xV1lDQ0Y5d3VCNGZYLF9ORkhWxxxxxxxxxxxx?s=ap"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It's recommended to add the Stripe GraphQL API as a [Remote Schema in Hasura](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/remote-schemas/index/) and connect data from your database with data in Stripe. By doing so, it's possible to request data from your database and Stripe in a single GraphQL query.

Here's an example of how to use the Stripe GraphQL API to get a list of invoices for a specific Stripe customer. Note that the user data is fetched from your database and the Stripe customer data is fetched from Stripe:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    # User in your database
    id
    displayName
    userData {
      stripeCustomerId # Customer's Stripe Customer Id
      stripeCustomer {
        # Data from Stripe
        id
        name
        paymentMethods {
          id
          card {
            brand
            last4
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get Started

Install the package:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install @nhost/stripe-graphql-js
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn install @nhost/stripe-graphql-js
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @nhost/stripe-graphql-js
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Serverless Function

Create a new [Serverless Function](/serverless-functions): `functions/graphql/stripe.ts`:

```ts
import { createStripeGraphQLServer } from '@nhost/stripe-graphql-js'

const server = createStripeGraphQLServer()

export default server
```

> You can run the Stripe GraphQL API in any Node.js environment because it's built using [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga).

## Stripe Secret Key

Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable.

If you're using Nhost, add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to `nhost.toml` like this:

```
[[ global.environment ]]
name=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
value='{{ secrets.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY }}'
```

And then add to your `.secrets` file:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
```

In production set your secret with your stripe production key (`sk_live_***`) in the Nhost dashboard.

Learn more about [Stripe API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#obtain-api-keys).

## Start Nhost

```
nhost up
```

Learn more about the [Nhost CLI](/cli).

## Test

Test the Stripe GraphQL API in the browser:

[https://local.functions.nhost.run/v1/graphql/stripe](https://local.functions.nhost.run/v1/graphql/stripe)

## Remote Schema

Add the Stripe GraphQL API as a Remote Schema in Hasura.

**URL**

```
{{NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL}}/graphql/stripe
```

**Headers**

```
x-nhost-webhook-secret: NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET (From env var)
```

> The `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is used to verify that the request is coming from Nhost. The environment variable is a [system environment variable](/platform/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) and is always available.

## Permissions

Here's a minimal example without any custom permissions. Only requests using the `x-hasura-admin-secret` header will work:

```js
const server = createStripeGraphQLServer()
```

For more granular permissions, you can pass an `isAllowed` function to the `createStripeGraphQLServer`. The `isAllowed` function takes a `stripeCustomerId` and [`context`](#context) as parameters and runs every time the GraphQL server makes a request to Stripe to get or modify data for a specific Stripe customer.

Here is an example of an `isAllowed` function:

```ts
import { createStripeGraphQLServer } from '@nhost/stripe-graphql-js'

const isAllowed = (stripeCustomerId: string, context: Context) => {
  const { isAdmin, userClaims } = context

  // allow all requests if they have a valid `x-hasura-admin-secret`
  if (isAdmin) {
    return true
  }

  // get user id
  const userId = userClaims['x-hasura-user-id']

  // check if the user is signed in
  if (!userId) {
    return false
  }

  // get more user information from the database
  const { user } = await gqlSDK.getUser({
    id: userId
  })

  if (!user) {
    return false
  }

  // check if the user is part of a workspace with the `stripeCustomerId`
  return user.workspaceMembers.some((workspaceMember) => {
    return workspaceMember.workspace.stripeCustomerId === stripeCustomerId
  })
}

const server = createStripeGraphQLServer({ isAllowed })

export default server
```

### Context

The `context` object contains:

- `userClaims` - verified JWT claims from the user's access token.
- `isAdmin` - `true` if the request was made using a valid `x-hasura-admin-secret` header.
- `request` - [Fetch API Request object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) that represents the incoming HTTP request in platform-independent way. It can be useful for accessing headers to authenticate a user
- `query` - the DocumentNode that was parsed from the GraphQL query string
- `operationName` - the operation name selected from the incoming query
- `variables` - the variables that were defined in the query
- `extensions` - the extensions that were received from the client
