A GraphQL API is automatically and instantly available based on the tables and columns in your [database](/database).

The GraphQL API has support for inserting, selecting, updating, and deleting data, which usually accounts for 80% of all API operations you need.

It's the [Hasura GraphQL engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) that powers the GraphQL API which means that all documentation about [queries](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/index/), [mutations](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/mutations/index/), and [subscriptions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/index/) from Hasura's documentation is applicable.

## What is GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that prioritize developer experience. The GraphQL API can be used to both fetch (query) and modify (mutation) data. GraphQL is especially powerful for frontend developers who want to build products fast.

GraphQL has grown rapidly in popularity in the last years and has been adopted by almost all major tech companies such as Facebook, GitHub, and Stripe.

Building your GraphQL API is a lot of work, but with Nhost it's easy because every table and column is instantly available in your GraphQL API.

## Endpoint

The GraphQL API is available at `https://[subdomain].graphql.[region].nhost.run/v1` When using the [CLI](/cli) the GraphQL API is available at `https://local.graphql.nhost.run/v1`.

## GraphQL Clients for JavaScript

The [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) comes with a simple [GraphQL client](/reference/javascript/graphql) that works well for the backend or simple applications.

When building more complex frontend applications, we recommend using a more advanced GraphQL client such as:

- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/):
  - [Nhost Apollo Client for React](/reference/react/apollo)
  - [Nhost Apollo Client for Vue](/reference/vue/apollo)
- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/graphql)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/data-fetching#graphql)

## Queries

A query is used to fetch data from the GraphQL API.

:::tip
The [Queries documentation from Hasura](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/index/) is applicable since we're using Hasura's GraphQL Engine for your project.
:::

**Example:** A GraphQL query to select `title`, `body`, and `isCompleted` for every row in the `todos` table.

<Tabs >
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request" default>

```graphql
query GetTodos {
  todos {
    title
    body
    isCompleted
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```json
{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to Nhost",
        "isCompleted": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Filtering and sorting

More complex queries utilize filters, limits, sorting, and aggregation.

Here's an example of a more complex GraphQL query that selects all items in the `todos` table that are not completed, with the total number of comments and the last five comments:

<Tabs >
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request" default>

```graphql
query GetTodosWithLatestComments {
  todos(where: { isCompleted: { _eq: false } }) {
    title
    body
    comments(limit: 5, order_by: { createdAt: desc }) {
      comment
      createdAt
      author
    }
    comments_aggregate {
      aggregate {
        count(columns: id)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```json
{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to Nhost",
        "comments": [
          {
            "comment": "Let's do this",
            "created_at": "2019-10-31T08:34:25.621167+00:00",
            "author": "John"
          },
          {
            "comment": "ðŸŽ‰",
            "created_at": "2019-10-31T08:33:18.465623+00:00",
            "author": "Charlie"
          }
        ],
        "comments_aggregate": {
          "aggregate": {
            "count": 2
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mutations

A GraphQL mutation is used to insert, upsert, update, or delete data.

### Insert Data

**Example:** A GraphQL mutation to insert data:

<Tabs >
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request" default>

```graphql
mutation InsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: [{ title: "Delete Firebase account", body: "Migrate to Nhost", isCompleted: false }]
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      isCompleted
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```json
{
  "data": {
    "insert_todos": [
      {
        "id": "bf4b01ec-8eb6-451b-afac-81f5058ce852",
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to Nhost",
        "isCompleted": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Insert Multiple Rows

Use an array of objects to insert multiple rows at the same time.

**Example:** Insert multiple Todos at the same time:

```graphql title=GraphQL
mutation InsertMultipleTodos {
  insert_todos(
    objects: [
      { title: "Build the front end", body: "Mobile app or website first?", isCompleted: false }
      { title: "Launch ðŸš€", body: "That was easy", isCompleted: false }
    ]
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      isCompleted
    }
  }
}
```

### Update Data

You can update existing data with an update mutation. You can update multiple rows at once.

**Example:** A GraphQL mutation to mark a atodo item as completed:

```graphql title=GraphQL
mutation UpdateTodoStatus($id: uuid, $isCompleted: Boolean) {
  update_todos(_set: { isCompleted: $isCompleted }, where: { id: { _eq: $id } }) {
    returning {
      body
      isCompleted
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how we are using variables as the `id` and `isDone` variables, which lets us mark any todo as completed or not completed with the same mutation.

### Upsert Data

When you're not sure if a piece of data already exists, use an upsert mutation. It will either insert an object into the database if it doesn't exist or update the fields of an existing object.

Unlike for update mutations, you must pass all columns to an upsert mutation.

To convert your insert mutation to an upsert, you need to add an `on_conflict` property for the GraphQL API to know which fields it should use to find duplicates.

The `on_conflict` key must be a unique key in your database:

```graphql title=GraphQL
mutation UpsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: { title: "Delete Firebase account", body: "...", isCompleted: false }
    on_conflict: { constraint: todos_title_key, update_columns: [title, isCompleted] }
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      isCompleted
    }
  }
}
```

This will update `body` and `done` of the todos with the title "Delete Firebase account".

#### Conditional upsert

Inserts a new object into a table, or if the primary key already exists, updates columns if the `where` condition is met.

For example, you may want to only update an existing todo if it is not done:

```graphql
mutation UpsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: { title: "Delete Firebase account", body: "...", done: false }
    on_conflict: {
      constraint: todos_title_key
      update_columns: [body, done]
      where: { done: { _eq: false } }
    }
  ) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

#### Ignore mutation on conflict

If `update_columns` is empty, the mutation will be ignored if the object already exists.

Here we have set the `title` to a unique key, to prevent multiple tasks with the same name. We want to avoid overwriting existing todos, so the update_columns array is empty:

```graphql
mutation InsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: { title: "Delete Firebase account", body: "...", done: false }
    on_conflict: { constraint: todos_title_key, update_columns: [] }
  ) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the insert mutation is ignored because a todo with the `title` `"Delete Firebase account"` already exists, and `update_columns` is empty.

### Delete Data

To delete your data, use a delete mutation. This mutation will delete all `todos` where `done` is `true`:

```graphql title="GraphQL mutation"
mutation DeleteDoneTodos {
  delete_todos(where: { done: { _eq: true } }) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

If you have set up foreign keys which will restrict a delete violation, you will get an error and will not be able to delete the data until all violations are solved. The simplest way to solve this is by set `On Delete Violation` to `CASCADE` when you set up a foreign key.

## Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions are queries that use WebSockets to keep the data up to date in your app in real-time. You only have to change `query` to `subscription` when constructing the GraphQL document:

```graphql title="GraphQL subscription"
subscription GetTodos {
  todos {
    title
    body
    done
  }
}
```

Your data is always in sync when using subscriptions. It does not matter if the data changes through GraphQL or directly in the database. The data is always syncing in real-time using GraphQL subscriptions.
